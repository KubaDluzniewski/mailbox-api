## CODING_PRACTICES

### Guidelines for SUPPORT_LEVEL

#### SUPPORT_BEGINNER

- When running in agent mode, execute up to 3 actions at a time and ask for approval or course correction afterwards.
- Write code with clear variable names and include explanatory comments for non-obvious logic. Avoid shorthand syntax and complex patterns.
- Provide full implementations rather than partial snippets. Include import statements, required dependencies, and initialization code.
- Add defensive coding patterns and clear error handling. Include validation for user inputs and explicit type checking.
- Suggest simpler solutions first, then offer more optimized versions with explanations of the trade-offs.
- Briefly explain why certain approaches are used and link to relevant documentation or learning resources.
- When suggesting fixes for errors, explain the root cause and how the solution addresses it to build understanding. Ask for confirmation before proceeding.
- Offer introducing basic test cases that demonstrate how the code works and common edge cases to consider.


### Guidelines for ARCHITECTURE

#### CLEAN_ARCHITECTURE

- Strictly separate code into layers: entities, use cases, interfaces, and frameworks
- Ensure dependencies point inward, with inner layers having no knowledge of outer layers
- Implement domain entities that encapsulate {{business_rules}} without framework dependencies
- Use interfaces (ports) and implementations (adapters) to isolate external dependencies
- Create use cases that orchestrate entity interactions for specific business operations
- Implement mappers to transform data between layers to maintain separation of concerns


### Guidelines for STATIC_ANALYSIS

#### PRETTIER

- Define a consistent .prettierrc configuration across all {{project_repositories}}
- Configure editor integration to format on save for immediate feedback
- Use .prettierignore to exclude generated files, build artifacts, and {{specific_excluded_patterns}}
- Set printWidth based on team preferences (80-120 characters) to improve code readability
- Configure consistent quote style and semicolon usage to match team conventions
- Implement CI checks to ensure all committed code adheres to the defined style


## BACKEND

### Guidelines for DOTNET

#### ENTITY_FRAMEWORK

- Use the repository and unit of work patterns to abstract data access logic and simplify testing
- Implement eager loading with Include() to avoid N+1 query problems for {{entity_relationships}}
- Use migrations for database schema changes and version control with proper naming conventions
- Apply appropriate tracking behavior (AsNoTracking() for read-only queries) to optimize performance
- Implement query optimization techniques like compiled queries for frequently executed database operations
- Use value conversions for complex property transformations and proper handling of {{custom_data_types}}


## DATABASE

### Guidelines for SQL

#### POSTGRES

- Use connection pooling to manage database connections efficiently
- Implement JSONB columns for semi-structured data instead of creating many tables for {{flexible_data}}
- Use materialized views for complex, frequently accessed read-only data
